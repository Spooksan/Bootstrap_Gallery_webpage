# Bootstrap_Gallery_webpage
Its a responsive gallery. All you have to do is replace your photos with the name a1-a9 and place it in the same folder.
Based on bootstrap 4
Contains a Navbar that  stays fixed to the top, dosent scroll away.
The colors has been changed.
I used unsplash, for testing the images/photos.
The images are separated by a nice border, the sizes are adjusted for all devices.
